              Exhilarating, Inspiring and Invigoration are the three words
              enough to define our club. Greetings to reader it is a privilege
              for us to introduce your to "Our Club" - Post Graduate club. Here
              at NIT Kurukshetra we believe students must not only be
              scholastically sound but must participate extra-curricular
              activities too and as we all know there more we grow the more
              boring we get thus to delete the word "boring" from the life's of
              Post Graduate student we arrange many activities under this club
              although as name indicates the participation is not limited to
              only PG students. These activities many include organizing and
              managing an event that helps students groom personally as well as
              socially.Students can gain confidence, learn to speak in front of
              groups of people, learn how to properly introduce themselves,
              learn how to communicate efficiently, make friends (skills you
              need), and advance their career prospects (skills you need). Jobs
              want people who can speak well and if a student doesn 't have
              those well developed social skills they could loose out on that
              job opportunity. Everyone is equally important to us be it a
              secretary or a member thus we invite you to join our club and
              experience indelible moments of your life.

              Music, dance and dramatics are the soul of any delectable event

              <br /> NIT Kurukshetra has always provided grounds for cultural
              festivities and MAD has been the backbone for the same. MAD
              ensures that all the intra and inter college fests including
              confluence, the second largest cultural fest of north India, are
              executed efficiently. Our tasks include, but are not limited to-
              Event and Stage Management Hospitality External Publicity and
              participation Internal Publicity and Participation Sponsorship
              Preparation of Items for Inauguration and Valedictory functions
              Results and Records You may find us behind the stage, juggling
              things in order to make sure that they don't fall and the event
              doesn't go off the track but we don’t always work behind the
              curtains. We also coordinate with various other colleges for
              publicity and participation.
              <br /> To say the least, we do the ESM (Event Stage Management),
              EP(External Publicity) and manage all the things that are part of
              the hustle behind a successful cultural fest. <br />
